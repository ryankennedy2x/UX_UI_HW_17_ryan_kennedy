                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Ryan Kennedy, a junior UX designer who has always seen the world through a lens of creativity. I have a background in graphic design which has equipped me with the skills to blend aesthetics and functionality in my work. I have a strong work ethic as well, driving me to push boundaries and deliver the best possible product. As a student of life, I believe in seeking continuous improvement in both my personal and professional pursuits. Outside the design world, I find solace in the game of chess (preferably paired with a cup of coffee), where strategic thinking and constant refinement align with my approach to design.</p>
